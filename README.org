#+title: Visualization of Taylor series' convergence

This script creates animations showing the convergence of the Taylor series (as more & more terms are included) towards various common functions.

To use it, just run `make setup` followed by `make run`.

Alternatively, you can also execute the two scripts `./bin/setup` and `./bin/run` manually, e.g. if you do not have the `make` tool installed on your machine.
